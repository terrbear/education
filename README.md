# education

This is a collection of scripts that I've used to help either demonstrate a
concept to my kids or help them learn things by rote.

# Installation

I've kept dependencies to a minimum in case anyone wants to use these. The only
dependency I've added is the colorize Ruby gem. Install it like so:

    sudo gem install colorize

Also, I rely on native OSX facilities and a shell for some things, so this
will almost definitely not work on Windows. If there's a say equivalent on
linux, you could just alias say to be that.

You need to run these scripts from a terminal (open Terminal.app), for two reasons:

1. I'm used to working in that
2. I want my kids to feel comfortable in terminals
